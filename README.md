### Events in calendar
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
    So, if you switch to March 2023, look out for the 26th. There is a mark here that indicates that an event is scheduled for that day.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
    Just click on that day and you will see the full details of the scheduled event.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
    For convenience, the day you are viewing information will be marked with a special color in the calendar.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
    So, you have viewed an event, but you want to hide information about this day and events. Just click on the "Close" button and the block will be hidden.
    </li>
  </ul>
